QSP Toolbox
=============
Quantitative Systems Pharmacology Toolbox
-------------

This toolbox was developed to support Quantitative Systems Pharmacology work.

## Current system requirements:
-MATLAB 2019b (other releases not fully supported, good compatibility with 2018b)  
 Required MATLAB toolboxes:  
  -SimBiology  
  -Optimization  
  -Global Optimization  
  -Parallel Computing  
  -Statistics and Machine Learning  

## Tutorials and documentation:
-There are several tutorials located in the examples folder.  
-Currently, functions are primarily documented in-line in MATLAB (i.e. type "help myFunction" following initialization).  
-The below AAPs J publication is a helpful reference to get started.  Note the repository code is updated since the paper.

## How to cite:
If this is useful for you, and you publish resulting work, please cite your usage of this tool.  
The most relevant paper is currently:

Cheng Y, et al. (2017) QSP Toolbox: Computational Implementation of Integrated 
Workflow Components for Deploying Multi-Scale Mechanistic Models.  AAPS J 19(4), 1002-1016.

## How to contribute:
-We are evaluating allowing others to contribute to the development on a case-by-case basis.  
-We will likely require a Contributor License Agreement with the intent all resulting work will be equally available for others.  
-Please contact us to contribute, or with related inquiries.  The current contact is brian(dot)schmidt{at}bms{dot}com.

## Other notes for our development efforts:
-The current fully public version corresponds to rev1125 from the in-house development repository.

## To install:
-Once you download, add the root directory (QSPToolbox folder) to your MATLAB path.  
-Type "initQSPToolbox" in MATLAB to initialize the QSP Toolbox for use.
